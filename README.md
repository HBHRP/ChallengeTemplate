#ChallengeTemplate#

**A forkable template which you can use to quickly set up your own security challenges for [HBHRP](https://github.com/HBHRP).**


###Instructions###

1. Fork this repo
2. Rename it to something sane. Don't panic about numbering, just give it a meaningful name.
3. Hack hack hack. It will probably work in your favour to do your hax on a topic branch. Feel free to reset the default HEAD on github to point to your branch. Or hack at master, just be prepared to be asked to rebase in that case.
4. When you think it's good, submit a pull request to the origin.

### Merge procedure

1. Open a pull request. Your pull request will not be merged, however this will give us a concrete place to do code review.
2. We'll either accept it or ask you to fix some things.
3. If it's accepted I'll ask you to sign a tag at the HEAD of your branch. I'll then subtree merge it into the main repo.
